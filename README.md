### CAPSTONE: Virtual Examination Surveillance System using Viola Jones Algorithm for Object Detection

In this project, we have created a virtual examination surveillance system that will be able to monitor the examinees throughout the period of an examination. Computers are trained to detect ‘inappropriate’ motions of the candidates during an examination. We have used Viola Jones Object Detection Algorithm for the detecting such ‘inappropriate’ motions. We have also attempted to create a simple user interface to highlights specific minutes or seconds where cheating like movements happened with links to the video clips of those specific sections.

### CAPSTONE: Predicting Credit Card Default from a Highly Imbalanced Dataset.

The objective of this project was to predict credit card default from a highly imbalanced dataset which includes only 4% positive cases (default cases). In such a setting predicting default becomes immensely difficult as the algorithm gets biased towards predicting the non-default. The primary challenge was to improve the performance of the machine learning algorithms by correcting the class imbalanced problem using different techniques like random over sampling, random oversampling, SMOTE, TOMEK and ENN and finally fine tune the model performances by selecting appropriate variables using information values and binning the required variables.
